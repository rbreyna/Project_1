This project is a web application that will allow the user to:

* Give weather data for a range of dates as determined by the user; if no dates are specified, give the user 2-3 days worth of weather data from the date accessed

**APIS USED:**
    * Yelp - https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
    * Open Weather Map - https://openweathermap.org/api

        - Select highlights (food, drink, activities, etc.)
    * Display output for both weather and selected highlights

**BREAKDOWN OF TASKS:**
